# STEPS TO USING GIT ------------------------------------------------------

## 1. We stage a file by clicking the box and adding it.
## 2. We commit the file, and type a message in the commit box.
## 3. We push that up to the cloud where the repository lives.


## 4. Ryan adds some code online in the repo and saves it online. We need to PULL those changes to our local copy on our computer.

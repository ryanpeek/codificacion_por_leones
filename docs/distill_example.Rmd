Making new code chunk shortcut is Ctrl + Alt + I.

## Important R Chunk Settings

 - echo
 - eval
 - include
 - fig. (there are many)

### Echo = FALSE/TRUE

I don't want to see this code:

echo==FALSE

```{r code1, echo=FALSE}
# hidden code
print("This is text that will print")
# this is hidden too

```

echo==TRUE

```{r code2, echo=TRUE}
# hidden code
print("This is text that will print")
# this is hidden too

```

### Eval = TRUE/FALSE

This is good for evaluation code or not, depending on what you want to show.
You can combine these (echo + eval) to control your document.

**eval=FALSE & echo=FALSE**

```{r code3, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
print("This shouldn't show up")
```

**eval=TRUE & echo=TRUE**

```{r code4, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
print("This shouldn't show up")
```

# Figure

using the `knitr::include_graphic()` function:

 - can control figure height or width with the R chunk options.

```{r includegraphics_html, out.width='50%', fig.cap="This is a soup can", eval=TRUE}

# straight from web:
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Can%2C_food_%28AM_2007.41.2-1%29.jpg/766px-Can%2C_food_%28AM_2007.41.2-1%29.jpg')

```

## for PDFs

We can't use `out.width`, but we can use `fig.width` for out chunks.

Try using: `tinytex::tlmgr_install("pdfcrop")` to help with cropping. The default is 6.5x4.5in


```{r includegraphicsPDF, out.width='50%', fig.cap="This is also a soup can", eval=FALSE}

# straight from web:
knitr::include_graphics(here("imgs","soup_can.jpg"))

```



# Use the here() Package

Use this package to make links relative:

```{r here, echo=TRUE}

library(here)

salsa <- read.csv(here("data", "Argos_Salsa.csv"))
head(salsa)

```


# Tables in RMarkdown

Couple packages that are good, these are the easiest to use.

 - `kable()`
 - `DT::DT()`
 - `gt`
 
```{r tables_kable, echo=TRUE}

knitr::kable(head(salsa))

```
 
 
```{r tables_DT, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

DT::datatable(head(salsa))

```
 


## PANDOC and MikTex or TinyTex

When rendering to PDF you need a few things:

 - `tinytex` package


To use special characters use `$` around the character and a `\`

$\Delta$ 
$\mu$ 
$\sigma$
